## Subscription Management System with Improved Personalized Dashboard

🔐💼💻

The Subscription Management System with Improved Personalized Dashboard is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline subscription management processes while offering an enhanced and personalized user experience.

In today's digital age, managing subscriptions efficiently is crucial for businesses and individuals alike. This project addresses this need by providing a robust system that allows users to manage their subscriptions effectively while offering a personalized dashboard tailored to their preferences.


## Inspiration

🚀 **Efficient Subscription Management**: In today's digital world, individuals and businesses subscribe to various services ranging from streaming platforms to software licenses. However, managing multiple subscriptions can become overwhelming and lead to overspending or unused services. 

💡 **Personalized User Experience**: Many subscription management tools lack personalization, often presenting users with generic dashboards that don't cater to their specific needs and preferences. We were inspired to create a system that goes beyond basic subscription management by offering a personalized dashboard tailored to each user's subscription habits, preferences, and usage patterns.ecisions about their subscriptions.

📈 **Data-Driven Insights**: Another motivation behind the Subscription Management System was to leverage data-driven insights to optimize subscription management. By analyzing user behavior and subscription data, we can provide valuable insights such as subscription utilization rates, cost-saving opportunities, and personalized recommendations for new subscriptions or plan upgrades.

## Social Impact

The social impact of the Efficient Subscription Management System is significant and multifaceted, addressing various challenges faced by individuals and businesses in today's digital landscape:

💰 **Financial Stability**: By providing users with a centralized platform to manage all their subscriptions efficiently, the system helps individuals and businesses avoid overspending on unused or redundant services. This can lead to improved financial stability by allowing users to allocate their resources more effectively and avoid unnecessary expenses.

🧠 **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Managing multiple subscriptions can be overwhelming and time-consuming, leading to increased stress and cognitive load. The Subscription Management System alleviates this burden by streamlining the process, allowing users to easily track, modify, and cancel subscriptions from a single dashboard. 

🎨 **Personalized Experience**: Many existing subscription management tools offer generic dashboards that do not cater to the specific needs and preferences of individual users. By offering a personalized dashboard tailored to each user's subscription habits, preferences, and usage patterns, the system enhances the user experience and fosters a sense of empowerment and control over their subscriptions.

📊 **Data-Driven Insights**: By analyzing user behavior and subscription data, we can provide valuable insights such as subscription utilization rates, cost-saving opportunities, and personalized recommendations for new subscriptions or plan upgrades. 

## Intel® oneAPI

Intel® OneAPI is a comprehensive development platform for building high-performance, cross-architecture applications. It provides a unified programming model, tools, and libraries that allow developers to optimize their applications for Intel® CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other hardware. Intel® OneAPI includes support for popular programming languages like C++, Python, and Fortran, as well as frameworks for deep learning, high-performance computing, and data analytics. With Intel® OneAPI, developers can build applications that can run on a variety of hardware platforms and take advantage of the performance benefits of Intel® architectures.

### Use of oneAPI in our project

#### Intel® oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL)

The oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) is a versatile machine learning library that accelerates big data analysis at all stages of the pipeline. To leverage the power of oneDAL, we employed the Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn*, an integral part of oneDAL that enhances existing scikit-learn code by patching it.

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install scikit-learn-intelex
```

***Usage***
```bash
Usage:
from sklearnex import patch_sklearn
patch_sklearn()
```
By integrating Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn*, We achieved substantial acceleration, with performance gains ranging from 10x to 100x across various applications.
